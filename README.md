# Homework 2 Portfolio

## Description

This Homework 2 Portfolio was created for boot camp students who were going through Module 02. It contains a portfolio webpage with personal info and previous projects.

My motivation came from my desire to learn advanced CSS and apply it in creating my personal portfolio webpage.
I created this webpage to show that I have learned and absorbed the information given to me through the Module 02 requirement from the UCLA coding bootcamp.
This helped me to achieve a foothold in building more complex and functional webpages in my future projects.
I learned how to build a webpage to display my portfolio and prove my understanding of advanced HTML and CSS.
