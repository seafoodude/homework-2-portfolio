# Homework 2 Portfolio

## Description

This Homework 1 was created for boot camp students who were going through Module 01. It contains a webpage with a relatively functional navigation bar.

My motivation came from my desire to learn HTML and CSS in the efforts to build a webpage.
I refactored this webpage to show that I have learned and absorbed the information given to me through the Module 01 requirement from the UCLA coding bootcamp.
This helped me to achieve a foothold in building more complex and functional webpages in my future projects.
I learned how to refactor a webpage to simplify the elements and prove my understanding of HTML and basic CSS.

## Usage

To use this Homework 1, you can click on buttons in the navigation bar to take you to sections of the webpage. For suggestions on what to study first, feel free to click on any of the three titles in the top right-hand side of the webpage. It should take you to the section that appropriately describes the title clicked. There you will also see a sidebar with tangentially related information.

**NOTE**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually we'll learn how to make elements responsive so that our web application is optimized for any screen size.
